    <h1 style="color:aqua";><b>web based attack</b></h1>
    <p>When criminals exploit vulnerabilities in coding to gain access to a server or database, these types of cyber vandalism threats are known as application-layer attacks. </p>
    <p> Users trust that the sensitive personal information they divulge on your website will be kept private and safe."</p>
    <h2 style="color:aquamarine";><b>Most Common Types of Web Attacks </b></h2>
    <p>
        Although the tactics of cybercriminals are constantly evolving, their underlying attack strategies remain relatively stable. Below are some of the most common: </p>
        <h3 style="color:darkgreen";><b>cross site scripting(xss)</b></h3>
        <p>That involves an attacker uploading a piece of malicious script code onto your website that can then be used to steal data or perform other kinds of mischief.</p>
         <p> Although this strategy is relatively unsophisticated, it remains quite common and can do significant damage.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color:darkgreen";><b>sql injection(sqli)</b></h3>
        <p> This happens when a hacker submits destructive code into an input form.</p>
        <p>If your systems fail to clean this information, it can be submitted into the database, changing, deleting, or revealing data to the attacker.</p>
        <h3 style="color:darkgreen";><b>Path traversal</b></h3>
        <p> Also resulting from improper protection of data that has been inputted,</p>
         <p> these webserver attacks involve injecting patterns into the webserver hierarchy that allow bad actors to obtain user credentials, databases, configuration files, and other information stored on hard drives.</p>
         <h3 style="color:darkgreen";><b>Local File Inclusion</b></h3>
         <p> This relatively uncommon attack technique involves forcing the web application to execute a file located elsewhere on the system.</p>
         <h3 style="color:darkgreen";><b>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks</b></h3>
         <p>Such destructive events happen when an attacker bombards the server with requests.</p>
         <p> In many cases, hackers use a network of compromised computers or bots to mount this offensive.</p>
         <p>Such actions paralyze your server and prevent legitimate visitors from gaining access to your services.</p>
         <h2 style="color:aquamarine";><b>Protecting Against Website Attack  </b></h2>
         <p>A companyâ€™s ability to use online resources to capture and store customer data has many benefits, but it also opens the door to malicious attackers.</p>
         <p> Fortunately, there are methods you can employ to provide analysis and protection for your site and its underlying servers and databases. They include the following:  
         </p>
         <h3 style="color:darkturquoise";><b>Automated vulnerability scanning and security testing</b></h3>
         <p>These programs help you to find, analyze, and mitigate vulnerabilities, often before actual attacks occur.</p>
         <p> Investing in these preventive measures is a cost-effective way to reduce the likelihood that vulnerabilities will turn into cyber disasters.</p>
         <h3 style="color:darkturquoise";>Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)</h3>
         <p> These operate on the application layer and use rules and intelligence about known breach tactics to restrict access to applications.</p>
         <p>Because they can access all layers and protocols, WAFs can be highly effective gatekeepers when it comes to shielding resources from attack.</p>
         <h3 style="color:darkturquoise";><b>Secure Development Testing (SDT)</b></h3>
         <p> This instruction is designed for all security team members, including testers, developers, architects, and managers.</p>
         <p> It provides information about the newest attack vectors. It assists the task force in establishing a baseline and developing a practical, </p>
         <p>dynamic approach to preventing website attacks and minimizing the consequences of breaches that cannot be stopped.</p>
