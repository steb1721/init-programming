# packet sniffing and spoofing
## #sniffing attack is data thefts perpetrated by capturing network traffic with packet sniffers, which can illegally access and read unencrypted data.
# classification of packet sniffing
## 1, active packet sniffing 
### It is the technique of inserting address resolution protocols (ARPs) into a network to overload the switch content address memory (CAM)
### table. As a result, legitimate traffic is redirected to other ports, allowing the attacker to sniff traffic from the switch. Active sniffing methodologies are used 
### for spoofing attacks, dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) attacks, and domain name system (DNS) poisonings.
## 2, passive packet sniffing
### It consists solely of listening and is typically used in networks connected by hubs. The traffic is visible to all hosts in this form of network. To discreetly
### monitor a companyâ€™s network, hackers will often employ one of two approaches to passive sniffing

## #Spoofing is a cyberattack that occurs when a scammer is disguised as a trusted source to gain access to important data or information. Spoofing can happen through websites, emails, phone calls, texts, IP addresses and servers.
